# Predicting Music Genres

This repository contains a **music genre classification** project for the **MYZ309E (Artificial Intelligence in Mathematical Engineering)** course. Developed by **Ayça Öter** and **Sena Seyhan**, it uses the Spotify Tracks Dataset (audio features, metadata) to predict song genres. Our workflow involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to classify tracks into various genres based on their numerical and categorical properties.
